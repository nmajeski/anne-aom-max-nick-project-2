### Chosen Topic and Rationale
We decided to analyze the attributes, behaviors, and locations of squirrels in New York City's Central Park during two weeks in October 2019, in preparation for winter hibernation.

In this project, we will use Python Flask to run the HTTP server. We will use HTML/CSS to structure and format the UI. We will use JavaScript (Plotly and Leaflet) in order to parse the data and to show it in various visualizations including maps and graphs. We will store the data in a SQL database. The data will come from an exported CSV file.

These are the questions we are trying to answer:
- Do we tend to see more squirrels during the day or night time?
- What type of activities are squirrels doing based on location (Ground Plane, Above Ground)?
- What is the behavior of squirrels around other animals?
- What is the color distribution of squirrels across Central Park?

### Links to Our Data Set(s)
Data set can be exported as a CSV file from the following:
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw
- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Hectare-Data/ej9h-v6g2

The datasets have over 3000 records in them.
The following data exists for each record: X, Y, Unique Squirrel ID, Hectare, Shift, Date, Hectare Squirrel Number, Age, Primary Fur Color, Highlight Fur Color, Combination of Primary and Highlight Color, Color notes, Location, Above Ground Sighter Measurement, Specific Location, Running, Chasing, Climbing, Eating, Foraging, Other Activities, Kuks, Quaas, Moans, Tail flags, Tail twitches, Approaches, Indifferent, Runs from, Other Interactions, Lat/Long, Zip Codes, Community Districts, Borough Boundaries, City Council Districts, Police Precincts
