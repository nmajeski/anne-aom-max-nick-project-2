### Chosen Topic and Rationale
We decided to analyze the attributes, behaviors, and locations of squirrels in New York City's Central Park during for two weeks in October 2019, in preparation for winter.

In this project, we will use Python Flask to run the HTTP server. We will use HTML/CSS to structure and format the UI. We will use JavaScript (Plotly and Leaflet) in order to parse and show the data in various visualizations including maps and graphs. We will store the data in a SQL database.

These are the questions we are trying to answer:

### Links to Our Data Set(s)
Data set can be exported as a CSV file from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw. It has over 3000 records in it.
